# Discord Server Cloner

**Warning: Using this tool is AGAINST Discord's ToS. If you're going to do this, make sure THE BOT IS OWNED BY ANOTHER ACCOUNT THAT IT IS NOT YOURS. If you get banned for using this script, don't blame me for it as I've already warned you.**

This is a Discord Server cloner. It clones a Discord server and forwards all messages into another server. So you can see what are they up to, from the other side!

## Libraries used
- hxWebSockets: Used to connect to the Discord gateway
- Console.hx: Used to, pretty much use colors in the console

## What is this tool and what does it do?
This tool will let you record and forward messages and channels from one server to another in real time. You will be able to see what are the other people doing on the other server, without actually having to be in the actual server.

## How to compile?
Download the latest version of Haxe, set up haxelib and run the buildandrun.sh script (Linux only)

Otherwise you can just get a pre-compiled version from the releases tab (Linux only for now, Windows builds will be compiled later)
